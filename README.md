# License
We have a Boost Software License 1.0 license on all of our bots, projects & websites.

# What does the license do?
The Boost Software License 1.0 license allows you to use our code for private use, like trying out our code & seeing how we work. However, you are not allowed to use our code for production, like selling it, using it for a public discord bot / website and similar. You may also modify the code to try, but not publish. The license gives us copyright over the code.

# Can I use the code for my server bot?
No, we ask you to only use our bots as we have the best setups behind the scenes to enchant your experience. Note that both our disnode panel & dashboard are opensourced, so free to use for anyone!
